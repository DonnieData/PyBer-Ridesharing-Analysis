# PyBer_Analysis
Visualizing ridesharing data with Python 
## Resources 


## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which pyber operates.
creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Analysis Focus 
- city type 

## Results 
through analysis and aggregation of PyBers ride sharring data, I have created a statistical overview and summary.

By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings including: 
- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cites have the least
- Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
- the summary shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher when there a surplus of drivers.
